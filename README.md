# MultiCore-Project
In this repository I share my part of a full project in which we automate an aquarium.

Here I include:

  1.- Temperature control design using a waterproof sensor which activates an AC heater or a DC fan depending on the detected temperature.
  
  2.- Water level control design using a level sensor that activates two pumps: one to fill the aquarium and another to empty it.
  
  3.- Manual activation of the filter, LEDs, and pumps via a web page.
  
  4.- Manual control of the LED's brightness, color and position via a web page.
  
  5.-A web page that displays all parameters for control.
