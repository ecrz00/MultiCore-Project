# Project Overview

In this school project, I collaborated in the design of an automated aquarium. The key features I developed include:
* A water level control system to maintain a consistent water level inside the tank.
* A temperature control system to keep the water temperature within a specified range.
* A web interface that allows users to control and modify the state of various actuators
* The ability to change the color and brightness of an array of lights.
* The ability to drain the aquarium when necessary.
* The option to activate a filter for water purification.
